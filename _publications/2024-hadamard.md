The paper presents a morphodynamic model which can be coupled with any wave model capable of producing time/spectral averaged wave quantities. This model based on a wave energy minimization principle highlights the morphodynamic phenomenology, such as the sandbar creation. Such a model can be used in solving engineering optimization problems. It is also developed to illustrate the idea that beach sand transport can be thought as a non-local phenomenon. We used wave calculations from SWAN and XBeach in our model, and we compared the morphodynamic results to LIP and SANDS hydro-morphodynamic benchmark as well as open-sea simulations. Using supplementary mathematical development, we improved the minimization method using the Hadamard derivative.
