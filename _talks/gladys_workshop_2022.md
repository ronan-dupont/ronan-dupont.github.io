The GLADYS 2022 workshop was held for the 6th consecutive year in the splendid village of St-Julien-en-Vercors. The participants were able to take advantage of this magnificent setting to work in a different environment while relaxing during splendid walks between 2 presentations.

This year, the workshop was based on various themes such as the CFOSAT project, which is based on the use of satellite data for the analysis of swells approaching the side of the island of Maupiti in French Polynesia, or the Esponza project, which took place in autumn 2021 on the Basque coast, to characterize the transformations of the swell on a rocky plain.

Each participant was able to present his research topic such as: hydrodynamics on complex bottom, lagoon hydrodynamics or bores waves around the island of Maupiti. The doctoral students present were able to present their thesis topic and others took the opportunity to present the progress of their research, including the presentation of the first results of the experiment LEGOLAS.
