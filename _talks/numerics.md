This year's NuMerics2024 (Numerical Methods for Problems in Fluid Dynamics) was held on Naples. Participants were there to present their work on mathematics applied to fluid dynamics problems.

The congress was held in the university of Napoli. 

My work was entitled Numerical solution of Mild-slope equation using Virtual Element Method [[PDF]](http://ronan-dupont.github.io/files/presentation/numerics2024.pdf).
