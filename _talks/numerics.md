This year's NuMerics2024 (Numerical Methods for Problems in Fluid Dynamics) was held on Naples. Participants were there to present their work on mathematics applied to fluid dynamics problems.

The congress was held in the university of Napoli. 

My work involved our optimorph model forced by a wave-to-wave resolution model (Shallow Water) [[PDF]](http://ronan-dupont.github.io/files/presentation/numerics2024.pdf)
