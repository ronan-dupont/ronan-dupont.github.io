This year's JMVPR (Journées de Modélisation des Vagues à Phases Résolues) was held on the Ile d'Aix. Participants were there to present their work on mathematics applied to wave-to-wave resolution hydrodynamics.

The congress was held in the idyllic setting of the Ile d'Aix. 

My work involved our optimorph model forced by a wave-to-wave resolution model (Shallow Water) [[PDF]](http://ronan-dupont.github.io/files/poster/Poster_AGU_2023.pdf).
