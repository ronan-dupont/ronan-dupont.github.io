This year, AGU, the world's largest earth science conference, took place in San Francisco. 

Participants could present their work in the form of posters or talks. There were 23,000 participants exhibiting work in fields as diverse as seismology, astronomy and ocean science.

My work presented the generic version of the OptiMorph model. [[PDF]](http://ronan-dupont.github.io/files/poster/Poster_AGU_2023.pdf).
