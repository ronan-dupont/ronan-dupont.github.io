I hold a PhD in applied mathematics, which I obtained on September 30th, 2024. My research focuses on the numerical simulation of physics. During my PhD, I worked on wave-morphodynamic coupling of the coastline using minimization principles. I was supervised by Pr. Mohammadi Bijan and Pr. Bouchette Fr√©deric, working between the Geosciences and IMAG laboratories in Montpellier.

You will find on my webpage my publications, talks, courses and my CV.

Research Topic
======

My PhD research topic was between physics (hydro-morphodynamics) and mathematics (optimization methods). It involved developing a new approach to model morphodynamic displacements using a global method. Traditionally, morphodynamic models solved the physics equations locally at the grain scale (transport models).

This research led me to carry out advanced numerical and mathematical developments, which resulted in a low-complexity version of our code. The morphodynamic code we developed proved to be very valuable from a phenomenological point of view. It successfully reproduced physical phenomena, such as the creation of sedimentary bars, that no other models had achieved. The code has been designed to be coupled to any hydrodynamic model.

Additionally, I am applying the Virtual Element Method (VEM) to the Helmholtz equation, a key equation for modeling wave propagation in various contexts. The VEM allows for highly flexible mesh handling, which is particularly advantageous in complex geometries.
