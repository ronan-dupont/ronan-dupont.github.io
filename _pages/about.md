I am a PhD student in applied mathematics for the numerical simulation of physics. In my case, I work in wave-morphodynamic coupling of the coastline by minimization principle. I am under the supervision of Pr. Mohammadi Bijan and Pr. Bouchette Fr√©deric between the Geosciences laboratory and IMAG in Montpellier.

You will find on my webpage my publications, talks, courses and my CV.
