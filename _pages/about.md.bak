I am a PhD student in applied mathematics for the numerical simulation of physics. In my case, I work in wave-morphodynamic coupling of the coastline by minimization principle. I am under the supervision of Pr. Mohammadi Bijan and Pr. Bouchette Fr√©deric between the Geosciences and IMAG laboratories in Montpellier.

You will find on my webpage my publications, talks, courses and my CV.

Research Topic
======

My research topic is between physics (hydro-morphodynamics) and mathematics (optimization methods). It consists in developing a new approach to model morphodynamic displacements by a GLOBAL approach. Traditionally, morphodynamic models solve the physics equations LOCALLY at the grain scale (transports). 

This subject leads me to carry out advanced numerical-mathematical developments that will lead us to publish a low-complexity version of our code. The morphodynamic code we are developing is very valuable from a phenomenological point of view. Indeed, it manages to reproduce physical phenomena that no other models manages to do (creation of sedimentary bar). It has the ambition to be published and coupled with any hydrodynamic model.
