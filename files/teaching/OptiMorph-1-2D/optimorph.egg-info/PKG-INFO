# OptiMorph 1D

This is the OptiMorph version in 1D working in a cluster using SWAN or XBeach.

The params.dat file consists of the following parameters:
0: T0 the wave period
1: Hmax the maximum wave height off shore
2: h0 the depth off shore
3: Omega: The domain length
4: Number of iteration
5: Mobility coefficient, defaut = 0.001
6: Type of bathymetry : defaut = 0 (linear)
7: #Maximum slope : defaut = 0.2
8: Cost function, defaut = 1
9: hydrodynamic model : 1 = shoaling, 2 = swan, 3 = XBeach
10: hydrodynamic mode: static - 0= constant forcing, 1 = dynamic forcing
11: gamma the breaking coefficient
12: geotube or not: 0: off, 1: on
13: geotube position [m]
14: geotube length [m]
15: geotube height [m]


## Installation

Required **python3.8**

external product:
    - with hydro_mode 2 need **swanrun**
    - hydro_mode 3 need **xbeach**
